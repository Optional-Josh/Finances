Idea is to create a finance tracker using python
For now write code that inputs date, category between expense and income and a description
Then to be written or appended into a txt file

0.1
- created details.py which holds functions that validates user input regarding its finance history
- created file_manipulation for the details or logs be placed into a txt file
- main.py invokes functions from details and file_manipulation as well as compile all the functionalities
0.2
- added comments to describe each functions
- function that consolidates all function for user inputs and adds into a variable
- function that acts as a main menu, serving as the hub asking for user options
- removed string in amount
- ensured to add new line for each record into file
- no longer breaks after a record is inputted, only quits if user quits via main menu
0.3
- transferred functions into a class for cleaner code
- removed return function from class methods and instead updated class attributes within the class method itself
