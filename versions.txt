Idea is to create a finance tracker using python
For now write code that inputs date, category between expense and income and a description
Then to be written or appended into a txt file

1.0 
- created details.py which holds functions that validates user input regarding its finance history
- created file_manipulation for the details or logs be placed into a txt file
- main.py invokes functions from details and file_manipulation as well as compile all the functionalities
